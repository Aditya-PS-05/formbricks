# Creating a Contact Form with Formbricks: A Step-by-Step Guide

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on creating a contact form using Formbricks. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user, this tutorial will walk you through each step of creating an engaging and effective contact form.

## What We’ll Build

We'll be building a simple contact form with the following features:

1. A welcoming contact page.
2. Fields to collect the user's name and email address.
3. A question asking the reason for contacting.
4. A message field for users to share their queries.

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Form

To begin, let's create the structure for your form:

1. Head to the Surveys page and click on "New Survey."
2. Select "Start from Scratch" to begin a new form.
3. In the form editor, click the three dots next to a question, then select "Change Question Type" and choose Statement (Call to Action).

  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

4. This will let you add a welcoming statement that greets the user and briefly explains the form’s purpose.
5. Personalize the greeting to make it inviting and encourage users to start.

<Note>
  The welcome sets the tone for your form. Make it friendly and inviting to encourage users to engage with
  your form.
</Note>

### Step 2: Adding the Name Field

Next, let’s add a field to capture the user’s name:

1. Click the Add Question button.
   <MdxImage
     src={AddQuestion}
     alt="Adding a question in Formbricks"
     quality="100"
     className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
   />
2. Fills the prompts.
3. In the right-bottom, off the long-answer button.
4. Configure any additional settings for this field, such as making it required.

  src={NameField}
  alt="Name field configuration"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

### Step 3: Adding the Email Field

Next, we'll add a field to collect the user's email address.

1. Click "Add Question" again.
2. This time, choose "Email" as the input type.
3. Enter your text to ask for the user email in your way.

<MdxImage
  src={EmailField}
  alt="Email field configuration"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

### Step 4: Reason for Contact

Now, let's add a question to understand why the user is contacting you.

1. Click "Add Question" once more.
2. In the form editor, click the three dots next to a question, then select "Change Question Type" and choose single-select option.
3. Enter "Why are you contacting us today?" as the question.

  src={SingleSelect}
  alt="Single Select question configuration"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

<Note>Providing predefined options helps categorize inquiries and can streamline your response process.</Note>

4. Add relevant options such as "General Inquiry", "Support", "Feedback", etc.

<MdxImage
  src={QueryImage}
  alt="Single Select question configuration"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

### Step 5: Message Field

Finally, let's add a field for the user's message.

1. Click "Add Question" for the last time.
2. Enter "Your Message" as the question.
3. Enter "Please write your message here..." as the placeholder area.

<MdxImage
  src={MessageField}
  alt="Message field configuration"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

4. You might want to set a minimum character count to ensure you receive substantial messages.

### Finalizing Your Form

Once you've added all the elements, your contact form is almost ready. Follow these final steps:

1. Review and rearrange the questions if needed.
2. Test the form by going through it as a user.
3. Customize the "Thank You" message for form submissions.
4. Publish the form to get a shareable link that you can use across platforms.
5. You'll be notified each time a user submits the form.
   - Go to your Formbricks account settings
   - Verify your email address is correct
   - Check the notification preferences to ensure "Form Submission" notifications are enabled

### Integrating the Contact Form into Website

After finalizing and publishing your form, follow these steps to display it on your website:

1. **Copy the Shareable Link**  
   - Navigate to the Formbricks dashboard, find your form, and click the "Share" button.
   - In the pop-up menu, select **Embed in a Web Page** from the options on the left.

   <MdxImage
     src={EmbedImage}
     alt="Embed Image configuration"
     quality="100"
     className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
   />

2. **Embed the Code**  
   - Copy the provided embed code and paste it where you want the form to appear. This will allow users to access the form directly from your site.

3. **Optional: Customize the Embed Styling**  
   - You can adjust the styling of the embedded form by modifying the `width`, `height`, and other properties of the `<iframe>` tag to better fit your site's design.

4. **Test the Integration**  
   - Visit your website to check if the form displays correctly.
   - Submit a test entry to ensure everything is functioning properly and that you receive notifications for submissions.

By completing these steps, your contact form will be live on your website, ready to collect submissions. Enjoy engaging with your visitors!
